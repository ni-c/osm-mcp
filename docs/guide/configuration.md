# Configuration

Everything is configured through environment variables, **every one of them
optional** — the server works out of the box against the free public
OpenStreetMap services. There is no config file and no command-line flag.

| Variable             | Default                                            | Description                                                        |

See the [environment reference](/reference/environment) for the same table with
the validation rules.

## `OSM_USER_AGENT`

The [Nominatim usage policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/)
requires a real, identifying User-Agent, so the server always sends one — the
default identifies the project and links to its repository. Set your own if you
run this at any scale, so the service operators can reach *you* rather than the
project when something misbehaves.

## The `*_BASE_URL` variables

Each backend can be pointed at a self-hosted instance — the supported path for
heavy, commercial or privacy-sensitive use. All of them are validated at
startup; the server **exits** with a `ConfigError` when a URL is:

- unparseable,
- not `http://` or `https://`,
- carrying credentials in the form `https://user:pass@host` — those would end
  up in logs and error messages,
- or carrying a query string or fragment, which would produce malformed request
  URLs and could smuggle a token into error output.

Trailing slashes are stripped. Plain `http://` to a **non-loopback** host
produces a warning on stderr and keeps going; loopback (`localhost`,
`*.localhost`, `127.*`, `::1`) does not warn.

::: warning OSRM needs the FOSSGIS layout
`OSRM_BASE_URL` must serve the `routed-car` / `routed-bike` / `routed-foot`
path prefixes, i.e. one host that fronts three profile-specific OSRM
instances — the layout of the FOSSGIS demo server. A plain single-profile OSRM
will not answer these paths. See the [FAQ](/guide/faq) for why this exists.
:::

`OVERPASS_BASE_URL` takes a **comma-separated list** of interpreter endpoints.
They are tried in order: a 429 or 5xx from one endpoint fails over to the next,
which is how the default configuration survives the main instance being busy.

## `ORS_API_KEY`

The only secret, and it is optional. When set, `route`, `route_matrix` and
`isochrone` switch from the shared OSRM/Valhalla demo servers to
[OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org), which gives you a per-key
quota (free tier: 2 000 directions/day, 40/minute) instead of shared
best-effort capacity. `optimize_route` always uses OSRM — ORS has no equivalent
of the OSRM `/trip` service in its core API.

Handling, because it is a secret:

- **Removed from `process.env` immediately after loading** — before any
  validation can throw — so it is not visible to child processes or in
  `/proc/<pid>/environ` even when the server keeps running after a caught
  configuration error.
- **Redacted from error messages** before they reach the model context.
- **Refused over cleartext:** the server exits if `ORS_BASE_URL` is a plain
  `http://` non-loopback URL while a key is set, because the key travels in an
  `Authorization` header.

## `OSM_CACHE_TTL`

Identical upstream requests are served from an in-memory cache for this many
seconds (default one hour, at most 500 entries, responses over 1 MB are never
cached). Caching is not just a speed-up here — the Nominatim policy explicitly
asks clients to cache results. `0` disables it, e.g. against a rapidly-changing
self-hosted instance.

Must be a plain number of seconds; anything else is a startup error. The
invalid value itself is deliberately not echoed in the error message — an API
key pasted into the wrong variable would otherwise be printed into the MCP
host's log.

## Fixed behaviour

Not configurable, deliberately:

| Behaviour                     | Value                     | Why                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rate limit, per service       | ~1 request/second         | Nominatim and FOSSGIS policies ask for exactly that              |
| ORS rate limit                | ~40 requests/minute       | The ORS free-tier per-minute quota                               |
| Overpass concurrency          | 2 requests                | The public instance grants ~2 slots per IP                       |
| Request timeout               | 30 s (Overpass: 40 s)     | A hung request would hang the tool call                          |
| HTTP redirects                | never followed            | A redirect would replay headers at whatever host it names        |
| Matrix size                   | origins + destinations ≤ 25 | Stays within the public OSRM usage policy                      |
| Turn-by-turn steps            | first 100                 | A continental route has tens of thousands of steps               |
| POI tags in `poi_details`     | 60 tags, 500 chars each   | Mega-relations carry hundreds of tags                            |
