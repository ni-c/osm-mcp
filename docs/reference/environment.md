# Environment variables

The complete set. **Every variable is optional** — the server works out of the
box against the free public OpenStreetMap services. There is no config file and
no command-line flag.

| Variable             | Required | Default                                                                                    | Description                                                                                          |

## Validation rules

Every `*_BASE_URL` value is validated at startup; the server exits with a
`ConfigError` when a rule is violated. Deliberately, the offending **value is
never echoed** in the error message — an API key pasted into the wrong variable
would otherwise be printed verbatim into the MCP host's log.

| Rule                                     | Behaviour                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Unparseable by `new URL()`               | Server exits with an error          |
| Scheme other than `http`/`https`         | Server exits with an error          |
| Contains `user:pass@`                    | Server exits with an error          |
| Contains a query string or fragment      | Server exits with an error          |
| Trailing slashes                         | Stripped                            |
| Plain `http` to a remote host            | Warning on stderr, server continues |
| Plain `http` to loopback                 | No warning                          |

Loopback means `localhost`, `*.localhost`, `127.*` or `::1` (IPv6 brackets are
stripped before matching).

Two more rules:

- `OSM_CACHE_TTL` must be a plain number of seconds; anything else exits.
- `ORS_BASE_URL` must be `https://` (or loopback) while `ORS_API_KEY` is set —
  the key travels in an `Authorization` header and would otherwise cross the
  network unencrypted.

## `ORS_API_KEY` handling

The only secret. It is **deleted from `process.env` immediately after
loading** — before any validation can throw — so it is not visible to child
processes or in `/proc/<pid>/environ` even if a caller catches the
`ConfigError` and keeps running. It is also redacted from error messages before
they reach the model context.

## Not configurable

| Behaviour                 | Value                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Rate limit, per service   | ~1 request/second (ORS: ~40/minute) |
| Overpass concurrency      | 2 requests                  |
| Request timeout           | 30 s (Overpass: 40 s)       |
| HTTP redirects            | never followed              |
| Cache size                | 500 entries, ≤ 1 MB each    |
| Matrix size               | origins + destinations ≤ 25 |
| Turn-by-turn steps        | first 100                   |
| `poi_details` tag budget  | 60 tags, 500 chars per value |

## Narrowing the tool list

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OSM_ALLOW_TOOLS` | no | Tool names, `list_*` prefixes or `essential`; only these register |
| `OSM_DENY_TOOLS` | no | Same syntax; subtracted from whatever the allow list left |

Both are comma-separated. Each entry is either an exact tool name or a prefix with
a single trailing `*`. Entries are trimmed and matched case-insensitively; empty
entries are ignored, and a value that is empty or only whitespace counts as unset —
`OSM_ALLOW_TOOLS=` in a compose file does not mean "allow nothing".
`essential` is recognised only in the allow list, and selects `geocode`, `reverse_geocode`, `find_nearby_pois`, `poi_details`, `route`, `map_link`.

**An entry that matches no tool aborts startup**, naming the entry and listing the
valid names, as does a malformed pattern such as `*_x` or `list_*_x`. The
alternative — ignoring the entry — leaves a tool missing from `tools/list` with
nothing pointing at the cause. If both lists together remove everything, the server
refuses to start rather than offering an empty tool list.
