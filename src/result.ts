 *
 * OpenStreetMap is editable by anyone on earth, and every string this server
 * returns — a POI's `name`, Nominatim's `display_name`, a street name inside an
 * OSRM turn instruction — is whatever a mapper typed. `JSON.stringify` escapes
 * everything below U+0020 and nothing above it, so U+007F, the C1 block
 * (U+0080–U+009F, which contains CSI at U+009B) and the BiDi overrides
 * U+202A–U+202E travelled through verbatim. The error path had no JSON encoding
 * at all: an upstream body is concatenated straight into the text block, and the
 * default Overpass endpoint is a community mirror this project does not run.
 *
 * Tab, newline and carriage return stay in both: they are real formatting, and
 * the pretty-printed JSON is made of them.
 *
 * The two classes differ by exactly one pair, and it is a domain decision rather
 * than a security one. U+200E and U+200F (LRM/RLM) appear **legitimately** in OSM
 * names — an Arabic or Hebrew name with a Latin-script fragment needs them to
 * render in the intended order, and stripping them corrupts the name of a real
 * place. They are marks, not overrides: they cannot reorder surrounding text the
 * way U+202A–U+202E can. In an upstream error body there is no such name to
 * protect, so that path takes the full set.
